<h1 id="h">Steps To Reading Books</h1>

<h1 id="head">1.It increases intelligence.</h1>
<p>As Dr. Seuss once wrote, "The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." Diving into a good book opens up a whole world of knowledge starting from a very young age. Exposure to vocabulary through reading (particularly reading children's books) not only leads to higher score on reading tests, but also higher scores on general tests of intelligence for children. Plus, stronger early reading skills may mean higher intelligence later in life.</p>
<h1 id="head">2.Plus, it can boost your brainpower.</h1>
<p>Not only does regular reading help make you smarter, but it can also actually increase your brainpower. Just like going for a jog exercises your cardiovascular system, reading regularly improves memory function by giving your brain a good workout. With age comes a decline in memory and brain function, but regular reading may help slow the process, keeping minds sharper longer, according to research published in Neurology.</p>
<h1 id="head">3.Reading can make you more empathetic.</h1>
<p>Getting lost in a good read can make it easier for you to relate to others. Literary fiction, specifically, has the power to help its readers understand what others are thinking by reading other people's emotions, according to research published in Science. The impact is much more significant on those who read literary fiction as opposed to those who read nonfiction. "Understanding others' mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies," David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano wrote of their findings.</p>
<h1 id="head">4.Flipping pages can help you understand what you're reading.</h1>
<p>When it comes to actually remembering what you're reading, you're better off going with a book than you are an e-book. The feel of paper pages under your fingertips provides your brain with some context, which can lead to a deeper understanding and better comprehension of the subject you're reading about, Wired reports.1 So to reap the benefits of a good read, opt for the kind with physical pages.</p>
<h1 id="head">5.Reading can help you relax.</h1>
<p>There's a reason snuggling up with a good book (and maybe a glass of wine) after a long day sounds so appealing. Research suggests that reading can work as a serious stress-buster.3 One 2009 study by Sussex University researchers showed that reading may reduce stress by as much as 68 percent. "It really doesn't matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a while exploring the domain of the author's imagination," cognitive neuropsychologist David Lewisâ€‹ told The Telegraph.
